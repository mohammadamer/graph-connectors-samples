# Ingest markdown content from a custom API using C#, .NET and Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio

## Summary

This sample project uses Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio to simplify the process of creating a [Microsoft Graph connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/connecting-external-content-connectors-overview) that ingests data from a custom API to Microsoft Graph. It provides an end to end example of creating the connector, ingesting content and refreshing the ingested content on a schedule. It also includes the [simplified admin experience](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/connecting-external-content-deploy-teams) which means that admins can toggle the connector on and off from the Microsoft Teams admin center.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 17.9.6+ with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload and **Microsoft Teams development tools**
- [Microsoft 365 Developer tenant](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) with [uploading custom apps enabled](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/m365-apps/prerequisites#prepare-a-developer-tenant-for-testing) (optional, only if you want to test the sample on a Microsoft 365 tenant)

## Minimal path to awesome

You can run this sample in three ways:

1. **Simulated debugging with Dev Proxy** where you can test your code locally without deploying any resource to Azure and Microsoft 365.
1. **Debug locally against a Microsoft 365 tenant** where you package the project as a Teams app and deploy it to Microsoft 365. You run the Graph connector locally and expose it across the internet using a dev tunnel.
1. **Deploy to Azure and test against a Microsoft 365 tenant** which is what you'd do when you're ready to deploy your Graph connector to production.

## Simulated debugging with Dev Proxy

### 1. Project setup

- Clone repo

### 2. Dev Proxy setup

- [Install](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-cloud/dev/dev-proxy/get-started#install-dev-proxy) Dev Proxy

### 3. Start a debug session

- Open the solution in Visual Studio
- Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to start a debug session
- Wait for the Azure Functions host to start (you will see errors in the debug terminal, this is expected)

### 4. Start Dev Proxy and simulate webhook notification

- Open a command prompt and change the working directory to the project directory
- Run `devproxy` to start Dev Proxy which will mock responses from Microsoft 365 and simulate the custom API
- Press <kbd>w</kbd> to simulate a webhook notification from Microsoft 365 to simulate the setup process which includes:
  - creating an external connection
  - provisioning the schema
  - importing external content

> TIP: To monitor the activity check out the output of the Azure Functions host in the terminal window. You'll see the status of the different activities as they are completed.

## Debug locally against a real Microsoft 365 tenant

### 1. Project setup

- Clone repo
- Open solution in Visual Studio
- Copy the contents of `env\samples` folder to `env`

### 2. Create a Dev Tunnel

- On the menu bar in Visual Studio, open the `View` menu.
- Expand the `Other Windows` menu and select `Dev Tunnels`
- In the Dev Tunnels panel, select `+` to open a dialog to create a new tunnel
- In the dialog, enter the following and select `OK`
  - **Account**: Use any Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft, or GitHub account
  - **Name**: GraphDocsConnector
  - **Tunnel Type**: Persistent
  - **Access**: Public
- In the confirmation prompt, select `OK`

### 3. Prepare Teams App Dependencies

- In Solution Explorer, right-click the `GraphDocsConnector` Azure Functions project
- Expand the `Teams Toolkit` menu and select `Prepare Teams App Dependencies`
- When prompted, sign in to your Microsoft 365 tenant
- Wait for all tasks to complete

### 4. Start a debug session

- Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to start a debug session
- Wait for the Azure Functions host in the terminal window to start (you will see errors in the debug terminal, this is expected)

### 5. Start Dev Proxy

- Open a command prompt and change the working directory to the project directory
- Run `devproxy --config-file documentsapirc.json` to start Dev Proxy and simulate the custom API

### 6. Enable Graph connector

- In a web browser, navigate to the [Microsoft Teams Admin Center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com)
- Open the [Manage apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps) section
- In the table displaying `All apps`, search for `GraphDocsConnector-local`
- Select the app in the table to open the app details page
- Select `Publish` and confirm the prompt. You will been taken back to the `All apps` page and a confirmation banner will be displayed
- Search for `GraphDocsConnector-local` and open the app details page
- Select the `Graph Connector` tab
- A banner will be displayed. Click `Grant permissions`, this will open a permissions consent page in a pop-up window. Confirm the permissions. This will automatically toggle the connection status to on and start the setup process which includes:
  - creating an external connection
  - provisioning the schema
  - importing external content

The process will take several minutes in total. During this time you may see an error message on this page, however this can be ignored and you can refresh the page to check on the status.

> TIP: To monitor the activity check out the output of the Azure Functions host in the terminal window. You'll see the status of the different activities as they are completed.

When the process is complete you will see a table confirming that the connection has been successful.
